# RedditAvatars
A simple html/javascript website for grabbing any reddit user's profile picture (avatar) and saving it to your PC.

I've made this because sometimes I need to download my own reddit avatar and do something with it, and I always forget how to do it so I made a quick website for it, so that I can easily download my avatar in future.
